Q10. What is Java Garbage Collection? How It Works?. What is finalize method in Java ? 
When does an Object becomes eligible for Garbage collection in Java?

The Garbage Collection in Java is a automatic process for Java programs , to manage the collection memory.
The whole procedure happens in JVM( Java Virtual Machine). Every JVM can accomplish this process in many
ways, if only it is qualified by JVM requirements.
Finalize is a java method, which is non-static and protected. It is available in all kinds of objects the programmer
build in java. And it is used for final operations performance or clearance.
An object is signed as eligible for garbage collection when it cannot be accessed, or the reference variable of 
the object is a null value.
