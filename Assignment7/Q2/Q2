Two differences:

(1)ArrayList is more suitable for storing and accessing data; 
   /LinkedList is more suitable for processing data.
(2)Operation with ArrayList is very slow because it uses arrays internally. If any 
   element is deleted from the array, all bits will be shifted in memory;
   /Operation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList, because it uses a two-way 
    linked list, so there is no need to shift in memory.
